    "## Python as a programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "All programming languages have their nuances, their own way of ding things, Python is no different. As a programming language it tries to keep things as simple as possible, unlike other programming languages that isolate little bits of code using explicit characters, Python uses indentation and carriage return (new line) to define statements and blocks of code activity, we will see this next. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a strongly typed language, which means the type of data that is being processed matters, which may seem a little confusing at first because, unlike other languages, it is a dynamically typed language, which means that something can change it's type accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is pretty good at looking after it's memory usage, any processing needs something to process data and somehwere to store the data as well as the result of the processing. In other laower level languages, there is a requirement to manage this process explicitly, however in Python (and others) that requirement is managed by something known as Garbage collection that will free up memory if something that was there previously is no longer needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be extended by adding new modules, created in Python, or indeed created in a lower level language like C\n",
