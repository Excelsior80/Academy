    "It is the case that in industry there are patterns and there are standards that are followed, they are there for a good set of reasons: \n",
    "- They make code efficient\n",

    "- They nmake code clean and easily maintainable\n",
    "- It makes code testable\n",

    "Without going into great depth, the main point that is relevant, if you are new or otherwisem is that these are ideals that you should strive for. The main principle we will look at in this section is writing code in a modular wat that implements something known as Single Responsibility (one thing does one thing)\n",

    "Functions are a pattern that opntionally takes data and optionally returns value. As we will see, functions are central to the concept of modularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python they are defined using the `def` keyword, then the name of the function followed by brackets where the data coming in will be referenced (note though that whatever is in the bracket, is only a name to python, the data that the function will use will be passed to that name when the function is called). The function then has a semi-colon to indicate to the interpreter that the following lines belong to this function. Underneath the colon AND INDENTED are the lines of code that will run when the function is called.\n",
