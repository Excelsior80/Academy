    "You may well be aware of the constituent parts of a computer, that it has :\n",
    "- CPU : A central processing unit, that manipulates data, mathematically (it has something called an Arithmetic Logic Unit that is there to do exactly that)\n",
    "- RAM : Random Access Memory, somewhere that stores the data to be worked on, and the instructions on how to work on it. Temporarily (it stops doing that job when power is removed)\n",
    "- ROM : Read Only Memory, somewhere that stores the starting configuration of a system (sometimes referred to as BIOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the fundamentals of a system that is going to do compute, without these components it's an ornament. Even so, consider this, what are these made of, it's plastic and metal, but it's built in such a way that it will physically respond to certain conditions. The metallic parts are built in such a way that they act as a switch, or rather many millions of switches, all hooked together so that they respond to the states, these being electrical, and currently the conditions are that either there is electricity here, or there is not electricity here, at any one time in those many millions of switches.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Others\n",
    "- DISK : Something to permanently store data and instructions on how to work on data (a program) \n",
    "- KEYBOARD : A means of inputting data (this could be something else, could a thermostat be a form of input?)\n",
    "- MONITOR : A means of displaying data ( this could be something else, could a heater control act on data sent to it?)\n",
